Required commands
- `git status` before and after changes
- `rg` or `rg --files` to locate references
- `small-cli` or other repo tooling only via documented scripts

Enforcement notes
- Keep command output reproducible by avoiding runtime randomness.
- Never assume CLI behavior; cite files for expectations.
