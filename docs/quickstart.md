# Quick Start

Run all `small` commands from your repository root.
If executed inside `.small/`, SMALL will still resolve the workspace automatically.

## Initialize a SMALL Workspace

```bash
small init --intent "My project description"
```

This creates a `.small/` directory with the five canonical artifacts:

```text
.small/
├── intent.small.yml
├── constraints.small.yml
├── plan.small.yml
├── progress.small.yml
└── handoff.small.yml
```

## Validate Artifacts

```bash
small validate
```

## Check Project Status

```bash
small status
```

## What a SMALL Project Looks Like

A SMALL project consists of five canonical artifacts plus workspace metadata.
The set is fixed; growth happens inside the artifacts.

```text
.small/
├── intent.small.yml        # Stable: what the work is
├── constraints.small.yml   # Stable: what must not change
├── plan.small.yml          # Grows: tasks added and updated
├── progress.small.yml      # Append-only execution log
├── handoff.small.yml       # Regenerated resume checkpoint
└── workspace.small.yml     # Workspace metadata (kind, version)
```

### Artifact Evolution

| Artifact    | Behavior                 |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| intent      | Set once, rarely edited  |
| constraints | Set once, rarely edited  |
| plan        | Grows over time          |
| progress    | Append-only              |
| handoff     | Regenerated on handoff   |
| workspace   | Generated by init        |
