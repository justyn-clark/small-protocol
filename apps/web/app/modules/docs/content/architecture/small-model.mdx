# SMALL Model

Visual representations of the SMALL execution model.

---

## Ontology

The SMALL primitives and their relationships.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Schema --> Manifest
  Manifest --> Artifact
  Artifact --> Lineage
  Artifact --> Lifecycle
```

Schemas define contracts; manifests bind them to artifacts; artifacts produce lineage and lifecycle events.

---

## Execution

The sequence of operations when an agent interacts with SMALL.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Agent
  participant Manifest
  participant Schema
  participant Artifact
  participant Lineage
  participant Lifecycle

  Agent->>Manifest: Submit intent
  Manifest->>Schema: Validate
  Schema-->>Manifest: OK
  Manifest->>Artifact: Materialize
  Artifact->>Lineage: Record provenance
  Artifact->>Lifecycle: Emit events
```

Agents submit intent through manifests; validation occurs against schemas; artifacts materialize and generate lineage and lifecycle records.

---

## Safety Boundary

The validation boundary that ensures agent outputs conform to contracts.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Agent --> Manifest
  Manifest --> Validator
  Validator --> Outputs
  Outputs --> Agent
```

All agent outputs pass through a validator that enforces schema contracts before materialization.
