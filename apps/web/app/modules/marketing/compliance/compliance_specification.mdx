# SMALL Compliance

**What it Means to Be SMALL-Compliant**

This section defines the **minimum, enforceable requirements** for any system claiming to implement SMALL.

Compliance is binary.

A system either **is** SMALL-compliant or **is not**.

## 1. Compliance Scope

SMALL compliance applies to:

- content systems
- agent execution systems
- orchestration layers
- workflow engines
- CMS replacements
- AI-native platforms
- internal tooling that allows agent interaction

If agents can operate inside the system, compliance applies.

## 2. Required Capabilities (Non-Negotiable)

A SMALL-compliant system **MUST** provide all of the following.

### 2.1 Schema Enforcement

The system **MUST**:

- enforce schemas before execution
- reject invalid inputs deterministically
- prevent schema bypass by humans or agents
- version schemas explicitly

If schema validation can be skipped, the system is **not compliant**.

### 2.2 Manifest-Based Intent

The system **MUST**:

- require intent to be expressed as manifests
- validate manifests prior to execution
- separate intent declaration from execution
- allow manifests to fail without side effects

If intent is inferred from behavior, UI actions, or prompts, the system is **not compliant**.

### 2.3 Immutable Artifacts

The system **MUST**:

- treat artifacts as immutable
- prohibit in-place mutation
- create new artifacts for changes
- preserve historical versions

If state can be silently overwritten, the system is **not compliant**.

### 2.4 Explicit Lineage

The system **MUST**:

- record parent artifacts
- record the manifest that caused creation
- attribute actions to humans vs agents
- expose lineage as a queryable structure

If provenance must be inferred from logs, the system is **not compliant**.

### 2.5 Observable Lifecycle

The system **MUST**:

- define explicit lifecycle states
- enforce valid transitions
- emit lifecycle events
- reject invalid transitions

If lifecycle state is implicit or UI-driven, the system is **not compliant**.

## 3. Agent Safety Boundary (Critical)

In a SMALL-compliant system:

- Agents **MUST NOT** mutate artifacts directly
- Agents **MUST NOT** bypass lifecycle gates
- Agents **MUST NOT** invent new states
- Agents **MUST** operate exclusively through manifests

This boundary is **the core safety guarantee**.

If violated, the system is **unsafe for agent operation**.

## 4. Determinism Requirement

A SMALL-compliant system **MUST** ensure that:

- identical manifests against identical inputs
- under identical schemas
- produce identical results

Non-determinism must be explicit and bounded.

“Best effort” execution is **not compliant**.

## 5. Rollback Semantics

In a SMALL-compliant system:

- rollback **MUST** be implemented as a new artifact
- rollback **MUST** preserve lineage
- rollback **MUST NOT** erase history

Undo is a UI concern.  
Rollback is an execution concern.

Systems that conflate the two are **not compliant**.

## 6. Partial Adoption Rules

Partial adoption is allowed **only** if explicitly declared.

Examples:

- “Schema-only SMALL”
- “Manifest-only SMALL”
- “Artifact + Lineage SMALL”

However:

> **Partial adoption ≠ compliance**

A system may borrow ideas from SMALL without claiming compliance.

Claims of compliance require full implementation.

## 7. Explicit Anti-Patterns (Non-Compliant by Definition)

The following patterns are **explicitly non-compliant**:

- agents editing live state
- WYSIWYG as system of record
- UI actions mutating artifacts directly
- prompts as execution contracts
- logs used as provenance
- silent retries or auto-corrections
- hidden state transitions

If any of these exist, the system is **not SMALL-compliant**.

## 8. Compliance Statement (Canonical)

A compliant system may state:

> “This system is SMALL-compliant as defined by the SMALL Primitive Spec v1.”

Anything weaker is a marketing claim, not compliance.

## 9. Why Compliance Matters (Plain English)

Compliance guarantees:

- agents are constrained, not trusted
- failures are visible, not hidden
- state is auditable
- execution is predictable
- systems can be reasoned about after the fact

This is the difference between:

- **assistive AI**
- **operational AI**

## 10. One-Sentence Test

> If you cannot answer **what happened, why it happened, and what is allowed to happen next** without reading logs or guessing, your system is not SMALL-compliant.
